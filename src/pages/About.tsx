        <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I'm tired of working a 9-5. Tired of trading my time for money. Tired of building someone else's dream while my own sits on the back burner.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          So I'm doing something about it. I'm building capital through smart investing, and I'm sharing the entire journey with youâ€”completely free, no strings attached.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Liquid Phoenix is my path to financial freedom, and I want to build a small community of like-minded people who are on the same journey.
          People who think critically, do their research, and aren't afraid to take calculated risks to change their lives.

        <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This isn't some guru trying to sell you a course. This is a completely free platform where I track my trades, share my thinking, and connect with intelligent people who want to talk about stocks and strategies.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You can see exactly what positions I'm holding, how they're performing, and why I made those decisions. The community page is where we discuss ideas, share due diligence, and learn from each other. The news feed keeps us informed about what's moving markets.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed font-medium">
          Remember: scared money doesn't make money. Just be calculated with it.
